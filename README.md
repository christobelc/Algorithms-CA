Problem1:
-----Written Question-------

Problem2: 
Assuming that you have an array of 10 million randomly generated id numbers to search
through, write a Java program that uses binary search algorithm by creating 10 parallel threads
that search a particular id number. Each thread searches through only 1 million records. The
first thread that finds the id number should cause the rest of the threads to stop. You may use
the binary search we have implemented in the lecture class.

Problem3:
a. Explain the purpose of exception handling by taking the following scenario below.
b. Write a piece of Java code that illustrates how you handle the scenario selected in (a)”
c. Write a piece of Java code that illustrates the finally keyword that prints a “Thank you !”
after handing the scenario in (b) 

Scenario: Users enter values that are not included in a predefined list

Problem4:
Use the data provided in log.txt and the scenario
listed below to answer the following questions. Create a Java class called Anomaly and write
all your methods within the class

a. Write a Java method that reads the file line by line and prints the content to standard output. 
b. Select one scenario from the list below and write a piece of Java method that detects the
anomaly present in log.txt file.
c. Write a Java method that writes all the anomalies detected in (b) to a file called error.txt.
Only incorrect lines should be added to the file. 

Scenario: Missing an id number at all. Id number should be integer > 0
